# InformedWeb

Backend for Informed.

Uses Firebase to store user data.

### Installation

Written in Python 3.7.1 and Django 2.1.4

Download repo and to install all required dependencies, execute:

`sh InstallDependencies.sh`

This will also update pip if not updated to the latest version.

### Fabfile

Instead of using the `python3 manage.py runserver 8080` command, there is
an available fabfile.py to shorten commands and increase functionality
with only `fab start`

### Style

Following (at least trying to) Pep8
